    <h2>DEFORESTATION</h2>
     <section id="mainText3">
            <div id="six">
            Despite an increased public call for action on deforestation, a large majority of major corporations
            still fail to be transparent about their impacts on global forest loss. In fact, 70% of the 1,500 
            companies asked to disclose on four forest-risk commodities (timber, palm oil, cattle and soy) in
            2018, failed to do so. More than 350 of these companies consistently failed to report over the last 
            three years.
            </div>
            <div id="six2">
               <div id="seven">
                 These major brands, including Mondelez, Sports Direct and Dominos all use commodities that drive
                 deforestation, such as palm oil in chocolates, leathers for shoes and paper for pizza boxes.
               </div> 
               <div id="eight">
                 Meanwhile, of those companies that did disclose in 2018, nearly a third did not include forest-related
                 issues in their risk assessments. With some 92% of companies that do assess such risks seeing 
                 substantial impacts, it is clear that the business and financial risks associated with deforestation 
                 are going under-reported and ignored.
