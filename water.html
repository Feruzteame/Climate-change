     <h2>WATER POLLUTION</h2>
       <section id="mainText4">
          <div id="nine">
          Water covers 70% of our planet, and it is easy to think that it will always be plentiful.
          However, freshwater—the stuff we drink, bathe in, irrigate our farm fields with—is incredibly
          rare. Only 3% of the world’s water is fresh water, and two-thirds of that is tucked away in frozen
          glaciers or otherwise unavailable for our use.
          As a result, some 1.1 billion people worldwide lack access to water, and a total 
          of 2.7 billion find water scarce for at least one month of the year. Inadequate sanitation 
          is also a problem for 2.4 billion people—they are exposed to diseases, such as cholera and 
          typhoid fever, and other water-borne illnesses. Two million people, mostly children, die each
          year from diarrheal diseases alone.
          </div>
          <div id="ten">
          Many of the water systems that keep ecosystems thriving and feed a growing human
          population have become stressed. Rivers, lakes and aquifers are drying up or becoming
          too polluted to use. More than half the world’s wetlands have disappeared. Agriculture 
          consumes more water than any other source and wastes much of that through inefficiencies.
          Climate change is altering patterns of weather and water around the world, causing shortages
          and droughts in some areas and floods in others.
          At the current consumption rate, this situation will only get worse. By 2025, two-thirds of 
          the world’s population may face water shortages. And ecosystems around the world will suffer 
          even more.
