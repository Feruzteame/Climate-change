     <h2>ANIMALS DESTROYING</h2>
     <section id="mainText5">
             Human actions threaten wildlife in two main ways: by destroying and damaging the places where species
             live, and by using them in ways that are unsustainable. <br><br> 
             Vast areas of natural habitat continue to be lost to agriculture, urban sprawl, mining and
             infrastructure, or are suffering from the effects of pollution, introduced species that often 
             out-compete native wildlife, and, increasingly, climate change.<br><br>
             Meanwhile, many species are declining because of unsustainable levels of hunting, fishing and
             harvesting. Others are being driven toward extinction to support the international wildlife 
             trade, or killed when they come into direct conflict with humans and livestock.
             Human actions threaten wildlife in two main ways: by destroying and damaging the places where
             species live, and by using them in ways that are unsustainable.
